# QueryGrid Objects Configuration
# This file contains object definitions for QueryGrid tools, prompts, and resources

# Note: The main QueryGrid tools are implemented in qg_tools.py as they require
# complex HTTP API interactions with QGM systems that cannot be represented
# as simple SQL queries.

# Future QueryGrid-related prompts and simple tools can be defined here
# following the standard YAML object format.

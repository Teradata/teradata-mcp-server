# Process 
	- You will work through all the phases in order
	- You will complete a phase and pass the outcomes to the subsequent phase
	- You will be assessing the {database_name} database and all the tables in it

## Phase 1 - get database tables
	- Get a list of tables in the {database_name} database using the get_td_base_tableList tool
	- Create a list of database_name.table_name for the next phase
	
## Phase 2 - collect table information
Cycle through the list of tables, for each table do the following steps in order:
	- Step 1 - using the get_td_base_tableDDL tool to get the table structure, using the structure generate a business description of the table and all of the columns.
	- Step 2 - using the data quality tools, they start with get_td_qlty_ , gather all the quality information about each of the tables
	- Step 3 - using the get_td_base_readQuery tool, gather a row count for the table

## Phase 3 - Present results as a dashboard
	- At the beginning  of the dashboard identify the database
	- For each table present the results from phase 2 together
	- Ensure that each table is presented the same way
	- Use color to highlight points of interest

# Communication guidelines
	- Be concise but informative in your explanation
	- Clearly indicate which phase you are currently in and only focus on the activities of the current phase
	- Summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

# Final output
A professional data quality dashboard that is easily navigable.

# Flowise Example with Teradata MCP

[![Teradata Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teradata--Agents-Setup-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=teradata)](./flowise_teradata_agents/README.md)

Use this example to locally test Flowise and the Teradata MCP server with recommended defaults. 
Refer to the [Flowise client guide](../../docs/client_guide/Flowise_with_teradata_mcp_Guide.md) for walkthrough and screenshots.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Engine with the compose plugin available locally
- Teradata database connection details.
- Optional: Enterprise Vector Store connection details: PEM certificate, access token and URI.

## Quick start
1. From the repo root run:
   ```bash
   cd examples/app-flowise
   cp env .env   
   ```

2. Optional: Edit and update the `.env` file with your preferred configuration details. 
   If you don't the Teradata connection details will be inherited from your current environment variables, at least the DATABASE_URI variable is required.

3. Launch the stack with docker compose (this will build MCP server image from `../Dockerfile`):
:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URI=teradata://username:password@host:1025  # Optional - ignore if you have already defined it in your .env file or current profile
   docker compose --env-file .env up  -d --remove-orphans
   ```
4. Optional: monitor the logs
   ```bash
   docker logs teradata-mcp-server -f
   docker logs flowise -f
   ```
   When the services are ready, both containers report `healthy`, 


5. Open Flowise at http://localhost:3000/.

6. Quick Start
   1. Create an administrator account
   2. Click Agentflows>Add New
   3. Add an agent
      1. Select a LLM provider and model
      2. Select Tools>Custom MCP
      3. In *Custom MCP Parameters*, enter `{"url":"http://teradata-mcp-server:8001/mcp/"}`
      4. Click "Refresh" and you should be able to see and select the tools under *Available Actions*
      5. Build your flow, save and select the chat icon on top-right to test.

7. Shut down the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Customisation hints
- Edit `docker-compose.yaml` to change exposed ports, attach additional volumes, or swap container images.
- The `env` file controls MCP transport options, Teradata connection pooling, and Flowise ports; adjust to match your infrastructure.

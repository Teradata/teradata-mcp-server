**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
To be able to add the teradata_mcp server into existing environments like VS Code or Claude then you need to use a server config file, this file needs to parse the Teradata connection string to the server.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Get the code from Artur's example and put it back in
